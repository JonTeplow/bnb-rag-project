Video production remains at the heart of engaging audiences and driving business results. But with technology advancing at lightning speed and consumer preferences shifting just as quickly, what will video production look like in 2025?


From AI-powered tools to interactive video formats, the future of video is bold and dynamic.





In a world with so many options what is it that sets apart your workplace from your competitor? Bread N Butter’s President, Kyle Korelishn, predicts that "employee journey and company culture videos will become more and more important for companies of all sizes, but in particular large companies that need to convey why they are a great place to build a career."


These videos do more than just highlight perks—they tell your brand story. Whether for recruitment purposes or internal engagement, expect to see companies investing more and more resources into video storytelling.


Augmented reality (AR) and virtual production are redefining what’s possible in video storytelling. As Bread n Butter’s Executive Vice President of Production Jackson Butler puts it, “virtual production and augmented reality” will continue to grow in 2025.


Virtual production, powered by tools like LED screens and 3D environments, allows filmmakers and brands to create immersive worlds without the need for expensive on-location shoots. Shows like The Mandalorian pioneered this technology. In 2025, we’ll see even more brands leveraging AR and virtual sets for commercials, branded content, and live events.


Meanwhile, AR continues to bridge the digital and physical worlds. Whether through interactive AR filters on Instagram or immersive virtual experiences, brands are using AR to engage audiences in new, dynamic ways. Expect AR to become increasingly personalized and integrated into mobile video campaigns.


Artificial intelligence is no longer something you can ignore—it’s a tool that’s beginning to transform video production at every stage. “I think there will continue to be more use of AI within video production in 2025,” says our Digital Specialist, Becca Mamane.


AI is streamlining workflows, improving creativity, and reducing production costs. Tools like AI-driven editing software can speed up the production process by transcribing audio, automatically trimming clips, and matching transitions.


On the creative side, generative AI tools are helping create lifelike animations, visual effects, and even synthetic voiceovers that blur the line between reality and digital artistry. Expect AI to push the boundaries of creativity while also freeing up video production teams to focus on more strategic storytelling.





Phones remain king for video in 2025. “Vertical short form social content definitely seems to be winning,” says Bread N Butter video editor, Rachel Hardy. Long gone are the days when you’d spend the entirety of your video budget on a few TV commercials and call it a day. Today’s landscape requires a continuous stream of content optimized and formatted for consumption on the iPhone.


Pioneering a lot of the innovation is content created on TikTok: “I'm excited to see more creativity in TikTok's in 2025. There are new trends and templates created everyday on that app,” says Bread n Butter video editor, Kate Sullivan. 


On a similar note, cellphone video technology continues to improve, meaning we are not only consuming more and more content from our iPhones and Google Pixels, but also creating content on it. “Danny Boyle is using iPhone rigs to shoot [the horror film] 28 Years Later which comes out in 2025, and I think that's going to start a whole conversation about how iPhone cameras are basically as good as anything else you can use to make a movie short of RED or IMAX,” notes our Digital Director, Jorge Hernandez.


Our cofounder/VP of Marketing, Jon Teplow, predicts that “sustainability-focused productions” will continue to be a trend in 2025. Remote production techniques—enabled by cloud technology and virtual collaboration tools—help reduce travel emissions and on-set waste. 


Sustainability is also becoming a storytelling theme in itself. Consumers appreciate transparency from brands, and eco-conscious narratives will continue to resonate in campaigns. For example, Bread n Butter worked with Novelis to create a brand video that displayed at Mercedes-Benz featuring Novelis’ promise of recycling.


Companies that prioritize green production practices and highlight sustainability in their content will stand out in 2025.


With so much content competing for attention, making audiences laugh is a surefire way to cut through the noise. Our Sales & Marketing Program Manager, Hannah Martz, predicts that “funny, explainer videos” will trend in 2025. Apple’s humorous sustainability video update with “Mother Nature” is a great example of one such case. 


From witty TikTok trends to playful ad campaigns, brands are embracing humor as a way to connect authentically and build emotional resonance. The key to success in 2025 will be understanding your audience’s sense of humor and delivering content that feels both entertaining and authentic. Brands willing to take creative risks will win big—because at the end of the day, who doesn’t love a good laugh?
