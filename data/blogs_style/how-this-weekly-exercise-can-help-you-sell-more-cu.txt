How were your holidays? A distant memory? Mine too.
But here’s something that happened that’ll be forever burned into my dome …
It was the bewildered look on a woman’s face at a party when she learned I used to be in the automotive diagnostic and repair business.
The truth is most people have trouble associating me with some of life’s grittier pursuits.
The only time you’ll see me rolling up my sleeves is when I’m washing delicate stemware. Plus, I’ve got these soft, office hands. Tender paws that were built more for plucking lint from my cardigans than turning wrenches.
When it comes to cars, my knowledge stops at refilling the wiper fluid. But I was still able to bond with automotive technicians because I took the time to get to know them. 
First, I asked loads of questions. Then, I used whatever they said—in their exact language—to develop marketing that spoke to them at their emotional core. 
And because feelings drive everything, we doubled our number of customers from 25,000 to 50,000 during the five years I was there.
I didn’t have to know anything about cars. I had to know everything about people. 
That’s why you should always remember …
Your most valuable marketing assets are the conversations you have with your audience.
If you don’t believe me, think about every one of your other marketing assets such as your website, your lead funnel, or your onboarding communications. How powerful would they be if you didn’t have the audience insights to fuel them?
Dan Kennedy, one of our greatest living marketing strategists, says: “Successful businesses understand that their list is their lifeline. It’s not just a collection of names; it’s a pipeline of future wealth.”
Dan isn’t just referring to selling multiple products to your customers over the life of the relationship. It’s also about keeping up with their shifting needs. So, you always know how to … 
Position something you have as something they want.
If you think spending time with different segments of your audience is a lot of work, you’re right. And for an enormous fee, I’ll be happy to do it for you. But I’ve got a more budget-friendly option …
What if you dedicated just one hour a week to having conversations with your audience? In person or over the phone. At the coffee shop or at the bar. 
Do it for a month and you’ll have enough information to add depth and richness to your marketing that wasn’t there before.
Do it for a year and your prospects will wonder how you’re able to read their minds.
If you’re willing to trust me on this, here are five questions to get your list started:
Q: “What’s your biggest problem?”Every purchase starts with a problem. And when your audience sees that you understand what they’re up against, they’re more likely to view you as the person who can provide relief. 
Q: “What is your ideal outcome?”This is where you should resist all temptation to talk. Because the other person will begin to paint a vivid picture of an infinitely better future. Then, your product becomes the bridge to get there. 
Q: “What have you already tried?”Our natural skepticism grows with each failed experience we have. When you know what someone has already tried, you can position your solution as clearly different and better. 
Q: “What objections do you have?”Objections aren’t bad. They mean your customer is interested. Only they now begin feeling the risk that’s holding them back. If you can diffuse these objections, you’ll clear a worry-free path forward. 
Q: “What are the consequences of doing nothing?”Human inertia is your biggest enemy. That’s why putting people at a crossroads is a powerful way to create contrast between their unfulfilled current state and the more promising future you offer. 
I hope this gives you a bit of encouragement to add more personal audience interactions to your schedule. (And if you have to deprioritize, delegate, or do away with less profitable activities to make it work, even better!)
One last thing … 
If you’ve got other interview questions that get your audience to open up like clams bathed in white wine and garlic sauce, hit REPLY so I can add them to my own bag of tricks.
Here’s a song to play you out >>> 
See you next time. — Matt
