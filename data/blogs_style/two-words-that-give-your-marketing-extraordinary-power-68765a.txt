Last fall, I wrote an annual appeal letter for a charity that the director refused to put her name on.
Refused. Her word.
As a copywriter, I’ve grown used to people who can’t do my job telling me how it should be done. That’s what happens when your craft is everyone else’s native tongue. But this rejection was more violent than most.
Had I revealed the contents of the signer’s medicine cabinet or shared a regrettable slice of her browser history, I would have understood.
But when I went back over the letter to see if I had made any glaring missteps, I came up empty.
All I found were the hallmarks of a persuasive sales letter aimed at getting former donors to give generously again this year.
Since I had written the appeal as a favor to a friend on the board, I could have just hidden my bruises behind dark glasses and moved on. There was only one problem …
I couldn’t let it go.
I wanted proof that my work was so offensive that when read backwards, neighborhood children would be secretly summoned to carry out Satan’s work. Or even better—I wanted proof that it wasn’t.
That’s when I reached out to Gerald.
If you didn’t know him by just his first name, Gerald Woodgate is a direct marketing professional in the UK who deals in providing copy reviews to tormented Americans.
Among the benefits of having an Englishman critique your work is that no matter how cruel the judgment, it still sounds polite. Kinda like being waterboarded with a pillow beneath your head.
When I opened Gerald’s seven-page report, I expected to uncork a geyser of criticism.
Turns out, it was barely a trickle. 😅 
I was relieved to hear that what I had written was fairly solid, even by British standards. But it was what I didn’t include that stung like taking a week-old scone to the temple …
A “thank you.”
Big miss.
Sure, I had thanked my reader eventually. But if you were sitting opposite someone who had donated in the past, “thank you” would be the first thing you would say.
And so, the first thing you should write.
According to Gerald …
“The words ‘thank you’ have extraordinary power:
Words so wise it’s as if they’re each wearing a monocle. 🧐
Whether you’re acknowledging repeat business or punctuating a first sale, showing gratitude is an essential step toward forging stronger customer relationships. Here’s why:
Consumers feel vulnerable.
So, even after you’ve removed the risk, silenced the skepticism, and made someone feel safe to move forward with their purchase, doubts can still creep in after the sale.
That’s why a “thank you” shouldn’t be reduced to some throwaway line you slap on a confirmation page.
It’s a response to the trust your customers put in you. And when they see the effort you’ve put into it, they won’t forget it. Which brings us to confession time …
If I told you I have a collection of thank-you messages I’ve saved from companies I support, you’d probably encourage Jillian to see other people.
But I’m a sucker for gratitude—especially when it shows off a company’s personality.
Here are a few favorites from the vault …
Lazy Gardens
The good folks at Lazy Gardens specialize in what they call “effortless houseplants.” So, those of us who struggle to keep plants alive can finally boast thumbs that are at least somewhat green.
Instead of a forgettable “thanks for your order,” Lazy Gardens includes a 4” x 6” postcard with directions on unboxing your plant, care instructions, a QR code linking to a video library, and how to handle a damaged order. 
Sure, you can get all that stuff on their website. But when you’re a company that celebrates sloth, helping customers save a step comes naturally.
Huckberry
It’s rare for an outdoor gear company to appeal to an indoor cat like me. But Andy and Richard from Huckberry are masters at drawing you toward the call of the open road—even if it leads to someplace with central air.
Their “thank you” includes a snippet of their humble origin story, a QR code linking to company happenings, and a short message that creates a feeling of community.
There’s even a tear-off postcard you can send someone if you end up leaving the house after all.
Atom Gallery
Nothing clears a room faster than saying you’re an art collector. At least among the people in my circle of drooling misfits.
But Mark and Rich from Atom Gallery make it worth becoming persona non grata in the clubhouse with the analog charm of a 3-D “thank you” that radiates gratitude.
Great guys, those two. And between my artwork and Latin expressions, the only friends I have left.
Now, before we shut it down for the day …
Promise me you’ll have a look at your thank-you pages, sales confirmations, or packaging inserts to see if there’s an opportunity to dial up your appreciation for the business.
If you’re falling short, just picture your customer sitting opposite from you and think of what you would say.
🤝 How has their support helped you realize your vision?
🤝 Do they now belong to a unique group of like-minded people?
🤝 Can you provide additional resources to enhance their experience?
Then, say that.
And before I get caught ignoring my own advice … thanks for being here.
