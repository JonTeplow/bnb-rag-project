What do you know about pottery?
If you’re like me, probably very little.
The only memory that really sticks out pottery-wise is my mom yelling at me for breaking a vase in the house when I was a kid.
But in a way, the history of pottery is the history of Marketing.
Since our earliest days, humans have made pots to store water, food, and other rations. It’s a modern phenomenon that fine pottery has become a symbol of prestige and status.
And there’s one man to thank for that (thanks for getting my mom so worked up, dude).
His name was Josiah Wedgwood.
This… is his story.
Born on July 12th, 1730, in Burslem—a town at the heart of the British pottery industry—Josiah’s story starts in a place rich in ceramic tradition.
He was the 13th child of a potter father who had trouble making ends meet (can’t help but imagine that 13 children are pretty expensive). 
Back then, pottery was a really crude and lowly art form. In fact, calling it an art form was really a stretch since everything Josiah’s father made was purely utilitarian. Pots, bowls, and mugs were made to serve basic needs—nothing more. It wasn’t glamorous, and it certainly wasn’t prestigious.
To make matters worse, when Josiah was only 9, his father died, leaving behind tons of debt and a failing business to his sons.
Even though times were tough, the Wedgwood boys were tougher.
They worked from dusk till dawn, churning out pieces of pottery to help keep their family afloat.
It was here that Josiah got his first real taste of craftsmanship—the way clay transformed under skilled hands into something useful.
It was also here that he contracted smallpox, a disease that left his left leg (which would later be amputated) weakened, leaving him unable to push the pedal that turns a pottery wheel.

But instead of letting these hardships define him, Josiah used them as fuel. Where others might have seen obstacles, he saw an opportunity.
His illness may have kept him from the physically demanding aspects of pottery, but it pushed him to think differently. He began experimenting with clays, glazes, and firing techniques, treating his workshop more like a laboratory.
Josiah wasn’t just interested in making functional pieces but instead, he wanted to perfect them. He wanted to create pottery that was durable, beautiful, and unlike anything else on the market. 
So at the age of 22, he went on his own and tried to strike it big.
And Marketing Bestie, he struck it HUGE.
By collaborating with a potter from the town over, Thomas helped cook up this beautiful green glaze that looked almost like a tortoise’s shell (hence its name “tortoiseshell.”)
It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. This was revolutionary for the time and the demand went crazy.So Josiah doubled down on the experimentation but not just in colors, in product lines too.
At this time in history, Britain was undergoing a massive wealth transfer fueled by the Industrial Revolution. A growing class of nouveau riche was emerging and they were eager to showcase their newfound status. 
Josiah saw this shift as an opportunity. 
These new bougie bunch wanted more than just functional household items—they craved beautiful, luxurious pieces that they could show off to their friends. 
Think less Yankee Candle and more Trudon.
Wedgwood got to work, crafting stunning tea sets from his shop in Burslem and they were 🔥FIRE 🔥. 
But as we all know, products don’t just sell themselves.Josiah knew there was a market for his pieces. He just had to reach it.
And reach it he did.Wedgwood didn’t just make beautiful products—he practically invented modern marketing to sell them. 
He pioneered strategies like mail order, money-back guarantees, and even “buy one, get one free.” 
On top of that, he had traveling salesmen to spread the word who delivered his goods for free.And pretty soon, he’d be delivering the most important set of his life. 
In June of 1765 (a little bit after the British Stamp Act was passed, just to give you some Americontext), Josiah got a letter from a Charlotte asking for a full tea set.Not Good Charlotte, not Charlotte York, and definitely not the Charlotte Hornets—the Queen Charlotte.
Now this may sound like a big deal for the time, but it really wasn’t. In short, royals were the WORST customers.
They would order one-off custom sets and still pay the regular price. It was like squeezing an orange extra hard and getting half the juice. It just wasn’t worth it.But Josiah didn’t see it like that.  Josiah understood that this was a MASSIVE deal. 
If the queen really liked his work, he would have the ultimate seal of approval from the world’s biggest influencer.And he won the queen’s trust. Handily.
Charlotte loved her specially made “Queensware” and Josiah started promoting himself as “Potter to Her Majesty.”
He could now sell his pottery to thousands upon thousands of people. 
But he didn’t.
Instead, Josiah took a different route—one that would increase the value of his work and cement his brand as the epitome of luxury.
He capped production.
While many around him thought this was business suicide, Josiah knew better. 
By limiting the supply of his Queen’s Ware, he wasn’t just controlling quantity; he was creating exclusivity.
And the plan worked. The artificial scarcity drove demand, making his pieces even more coveted, and in turn, more valuable.
Soon, Josiah was fulfilling orders for even more royals, and his brand exploded. 
Even Catherine the Great came calling (yes, the same Catherine who helped popularize Veuve Clicquot, if you remember that send).
It got to the point where Josiah had to expand production and he opened a warehouse and started trying out new techniques in mass production.
This set his brand apart as now Wedgwood had the opportunity to expand globally.Their reach got so wide that Josiah became globally known as “Master Potter of the Universe” (eat your heart out Pitbull aka Dale aka Mr. Worldwide).
While Josiah passed in 1795, the brand endures with the same focus on quality, exclusivity, and craftsmanship that made him legendary.
So, let’s raise a cup of tea and pour one out to the father of modern Marketing—Mr. Josiah Wedgwood.
1️⃣. Strategic Scarcity > Mass Availability Wedgwood didn’t just limit supply. He engineered desire by making exclusivity his product’s DNA. You can replicate this by:  
2️⃣. Brand as Legacy, Not Logo: Wedgwood didn’t sell pottery. He sold a narrative of craftsmanship and royal prestige. Modern brands should:  
3️⃣. Influence the Influencers (But Be Ruthlessly Selective): Wedgwood targeted ONE queen, not every aristocrat with a pulse. Translation for today:
