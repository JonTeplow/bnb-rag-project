If I could credit my obsession with direct response copywriting to only one person, it would be Eddie Shleyner.
I’ve dropped his name in this newsletter before. And for good reason.
Eddie is a master of taking even the most complex concepts about writing, persuasion, and creativity and distilling them down to the essence of why they work and how you can use them to influence your audience. In his words … 
“When I came across an insight—a technique or principle that helped me write better or think more clearly—I challenged myself to explain it in writing. If I can do this, I thought, it will prove I understand the concept and am ready to use it in my own ads.”
Over the last three years, Eddie has taught me:
💡 The simple mental “short cut” that even rookie marketers can use to instantly build credibility in your prospect’s brain.
💡 The proven, three-step secret to creating white-hot desire for your product—without using a whisper of hype, exaggeration, or high-pressure sales tactics.
💡 How to use a foolproof two-word test to determine the pulling power of your offer.
He’s even taught me how to write the three bullets you just read.
Notice how they tease the value without giving away the answer. That’s no accident. And paired with the right audience, they’re nearly impossible to ignore.
But it’s what Eddie taught me—when he wasn’t even trying—that I want to share with you today.
Onward!
I was taking his online course, Transformational Landing Pages. It’s 86 bite-sized video modules that teach you how to double (or even triple) your landing page’s conversion rate.
But here’s the genius part I never saw coming … 
About a third of the way through, Eddie introduced an “intermission” where he asked students to leave a testimonial. And he put a link beneath the lesson that made it painfully easy to submit either a text or video testimonial without having to leave the course.
Then, he did it again two-thirds of the way through. And one final time at the end.
I had never seen this ask-along-the-way technique before.
But here’s why it’s so insanely brilliant …
First, because Eddie didn’t just engage his viewers at the end of the course. He force multiplied the power of his ask by hitting us up right when we were getting value from the content. 
And whenever we receive something, we naturally feel obligated to reciprocate.
That’s the power of giving to get. And it’s used everywhere from hostage negotiations to cooking dinner for someone on the third date.
Of course, asking for a testimonial at any time is better than not asking at all. But the longer you wait, the less compelled your customers will feel to give you one—no matter how happy they are.
Here’s the second thing you can do to secure more testimonials …
Make it easy.
Eddie removed all the friction between his audience and his request by including a link to submit a short review inside the course.
It’s easy to act on a single click you don’t have to hunt for. And easier still when asked to talk about an experience that’s fresh in your mind.
Even if you don’t sell video courses, think about all the flaming hoops your customers need to jump through to provide feedback. Then, extinguish as many as you can.
Got that? Good because I’ve got Jillian’s favorite in the oven.
Wish me luck.
